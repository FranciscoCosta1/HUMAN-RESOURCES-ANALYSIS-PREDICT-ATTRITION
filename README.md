### Introduction 
Predicting attrition is one of the major challenges of modern businesses, being able to retain top performant employees is a major step to build a successful and stable business.
Many businesses do not consider the cost of hiring new employees or the impact of the ones leaving on a quantitative manner. Since Human Resources is the backbone of a business, building employee retention is an essential step.
Employees are no longer retained only by financial and benefits packages. Building an attractive and modern working environment can be critical.
Under this scenario we aimed to understand the **drivers behind employee attrition**.
